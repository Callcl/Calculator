# Interactive Calculator

## Introduction

This project is an interactive calculator built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is designed to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The calculator allows users to interact with it via both mouse clicks on buttons and keyboard input. It also includes features like error handling for invalid operations, such as division by zero.


## Features

- **Basic Arithmetic Operations**: Supports addition (`+`), subtraction (`-`), multiplication (`*`), and division (`/`).
- **Keyboard Support**: Users can interact with the calculator using their keyboard in addition to clicking the on-screen buttons.
- **Clear Function**: The calculator has a "clear" button (`C`) to reset the display and all stored values.
- **Decimal Point**: Users can input decimal numbers and perform operations with them.
- **Error Handling**: The calculator will display an error message when attempting to divide by zero, ensuring the application doesn't crash.
- **Responsive Layout**: The calculator layout is responsive and works well on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Simple User Interface**: The interface is clean and intuitive, featuring large, easy-to-read buttons and a central display for the results.

## Skills Demonstrated

- **HTML**: The structure of the calculator, including buttons, display, and overall layout, is created using semantic HTML elements.
- **CSS**: Styled the calculator to make it visually appealing, ensuring it has a responsive and user-friendly design.
- **JavaScript**: 
  - Implemented functionality for arithmetic operations using functions for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
  - Handled user input from both mouse events (button clicks) and keyboard events, making the application interactive.
  - Managed the state of the application using variables to store the first number, second number, operator, and the current display value.
  - Implemented error handling for invalid operations like division by zero.
  - Added event listeners to capture keyboard input, allowing the user to use the keyboard to control the calculator.
  
- **Event Handling**: Used `addEventListener` to listen for keyboard and mouse events, ensuring seamless interaction.
- **Logical Flow and State Management**: Managed the flow of operations by tracking the first number, operator, and second number, and ensuring that calculations only happen when all parts of an operation are entered correctly.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensured that the calculator layout adjusts for different screen sizes, providing an optimal user experience on both mobile and desktop devices.
